    This is an introductory paragraph. It’s long and only interesting for the really dedicated readers. Everyone else will just skip it.

    This is my first post in the brand new soupault blog. It’s really interesting, except for its
introductory paragraph of course. That one is boring and should never be displayed on the front page.

    Well, I mean it would be interesting if there was any content in this post. Sadly, there isn’t, so it’s no better than its introductory paragraph.
