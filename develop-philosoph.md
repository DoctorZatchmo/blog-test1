Buzzwords are the glut of internet posts. To entice the attention of readers, people litter their content with them. Science, psychology, and philosophy are all popular buzzwords.

"Science says…" 

"Psychology teaches.." 

"From philosophy, we learn.."

Though I hope I catch some readers' attention with what I write, that's not the point of the title above. <p id="post-excerpt">Take it from someone who has spent a lot of time thinking about and teaching philosophy and who's had some general success. A well-rounded basic philosophy is vital to building a life that exceeds expectations.</p>

Keep reading. Hopefully, I'll convince you I'm right.


## What is a foundational philosophy?

Take a minute and think about your life and how you live it. Think about these questions:



* What guides you to make the decisions you make?
* What leads you to take the actions you take? 
* Why do you believe the things you believe? 
* Why do you have the goals you have?
* Why do you think you should live the way you do?
* Why do you invest your time and resources into the things you do?

You might reply, "Most of that stems from how I grew up." Or maybe, "A lot of that is tied to my religious beliefs." You might even say, "I don't know, man. I just go where the universe takes me." Those are all common answers. At one point in time, they might have been my answers. That doesn't mean they are good answers. Here's why.

Kind, intelligent, and even wise people, may have taught you. There is still a chance that everything or some of the things you learned were incorrect. Likewise, there is a chance that everything or some things in your favorite religion or philosophical system are wrong.

And for the guy or gal who says, "I go where the universe takes me." Maybe that's a good idea, but there's at least a 50/50 chance it's not. (Honestly, I think the odds are much worse.) What if there's something that could give you better odds? That's what a foundational philosophy can do for you.

That gets us to the answer to the first question we set out to tackle. "But isn't it pretty simple? You're just talking about something like Stoicism or Buddhism or something like that, right?" I can see how you'd think that, but no. That's not what I'm going for. 

Neither of those is off-limits as a destination for where your journey might end. Stoicism and Buddhism both have practical philosophies for living life and being a good person. Here's the problem. You still have to judge whether they are _good_ philosophical systems you want to embrace. 

Given this, you need some foundational philosophy that gets you the basics to make those sorts of judgments. Otherwise, your only option is to try all views one by one and figure out which is best experientially. Life is short, though. None of us have enough time for such endeavors where we might accidentally end up stuck in a cult for years before we realize it's garbage. 

So, that's what we're after. We need a minimal philosophy to get started making good decisions in life without having to commit to some all-encompassing system with a bunch of rules and practices.

Major formal religions and philosophical systems are out for now. We need to start with something a bit simpler. You don't have to abandon your current belief system. Just set it aside temporarily while we think through these things.

We need basic principles we can build on and adhere to. These are the minimal things we won't compromise on that can lead us to something better. That's the philosophy we're after.

"What about the second question that started this whole thing?" 

Ok. On to that!


## Why do we need a foundational philosophy?

Want an honest answer? Ok. Here it is. (I hinted at this in the previous section.)

We need a philosophy like this because we need guidelines to help us evaluate the world, the information in it, and the decisions we make based on that information. And sadly, **_we're all much worse_** at evaluating information and making good decisions than we generally think. 

We all act and think like we have a clue about what's happening. When in reality, life and the world are **waaaaaaay** more complicated than we realize. Unfortunately, this doesn't dawn on many of us until after half our life has passed by. There are grown men and women walking around this world thinking they have it all figured out. When in reality, they don't have more of a clue than a 10-year-old kid.


## Reason One

So, here's the first reason:

**Reason #1**: It limits your chances of getting important things wrong. 

"Ok," you say, "that makes sense, but why care if I get things wrong?" Getting things wrong is part of the learning experience and is generally not bad. More so than we often make it out to be. What I'm **_not_** saying is that you should aim to be right all the time. That's not it at all. 

We should definitely be ok with being wrong about things. Honestly, we should be ok with being wrong about a lot of things. There is just too much to know and do in the world for most of us to be right about a lot of it. 

Being attached to "being right all the time" is a bad place to be. Most things people focus on being right about tend to be pretty insignificant in the long run. That's the distinction. _You should worry about being right when it really counts._

"Wait. When it **_really_** counts? When does it really count???"

Fair point. I can't just note that you should care when it really counts and move on. How do you know when it really counts? Let's tackle that.


#### When things _really count_

When does being right really count? It counts when it will cost you more than you can afford to lose. Yeah, I know that's a bit vague, but that's how these guidelines have to be. Since they're just that, guidelines. Let's consider a few examples of when things might cost us little and when they might cost us more than we can afford to lose. 

What are things you can afford to lose?



* Your dignity
* Your pride
* Your money (to some degree)
* Your possessions (a lot of them are easily replaceable)
* Your time (only to an extent)
* Your reputation (to an extent)
* Your relationships (maybe some of them, not most)

You get the idea. There are some things you can afford to lose, but some are generally not worth losing or are irreplaceable. 

Who cares about being right if the only thing at stake is your dignity? You can get over that. What if the cost of being wrong is losing most of your net worth, livelihood, or life? What if some of the religions out there are right and you stand to lose your soul? That's when the stakes are high, and being wrong can cost you more than you can afford to lose. 

And that's why you need some foundational beliefs and guidelines, a basic philosophy, to help you increase your chances of getting it right when it really counts. But is that it? Is that the only reason you're advocating for this philosophy? Not at all. Read on.

A foundational philosophy not only helps us limit the chances of getting it wrong. It also gives us the tools to assess and choose higher-level belief systems. 

**Reason #2: **It gives you minimal guidelines for evaluating and choosing more complex systems of belief. 

Consider the examples I discussed previously. Suppose you told me that you became convinced that Stoicism was the best thing out there. When I ask why you reply, "Well, it helps me in my life in all sorts of practical ways. It helps me deal with stress, focus on what I want to achieve, and learn how to be a better person." 

So, I ask some obvious questions:

	How do you know it will do all those things? 

	Because other people said so?

	How did you decide to trust those people? 

	Because you tried it out for a couple months, and you're getting 

	some of those results? 

	What if you're just experiencing a placebo effect or confirmation 

	bias? 

	What do you mean by "a better person"? 

	Are you sure you're not just aiming for something other people say is 

	better, but they're actually wrong about it?

I'm not trying to pick on people who've embraced Stoicism. These questions can be raised about philosophical views, religions, political affiliations, social views, etc. 

The point is this. How did you get there, and how do you know where you landed was the right place? You need something foundational to guide you through making those initial decisions, something that gives you standards you can use for judgment and evaluation. That's what we're aiming for.

Ok. Now we have two good reasons for developing a foundational philosophy. Is that enough? Well, not quite. To wrap things up, we're going to add one final reason that motivates the other two. 

**Reason #3: **It establishes the fundamental values that drive your efforts.

I can hear the consternation now…

"Isn't the desire to get it right and be able to choose a more robust philosophy of life what drives all this?" 

Not quite. Those are the ends a foundational philosophy should gain you, but not what drives the philosophy. At its core, your foundational philosophy should have some fundamental aim(s) that all others center around. This is the Northern Star of your foundational philosophy.

These values are the starting place of your belief system. They are what you will come back to over and over again. They are the very essence of your foundational philosophy and any further philosophy, religion, or worldview that you build on this foundation.

Of the three reasons, most people will probably intuitively expect #3 to be somewhat the least interesting and possibly think it to be the least important. Ultimately, however, this final reason is the most important. Because ideally, everything in your life will be structured so that each part and aspect ties back to these fundamental values. Ideally, your beliefs and worldview are a coherent whole relying upon and connected to these values.

So that's the bottom line. Everyone has a foundational philosophy, whether they know it or not. Most are an incoherent and inconsistent mess. Foundational philosophies are fundamental rules and guidelines used to build our more robust and complex belief systems. 


#### Wrapping Up

You need a foundational philosophy to limit getting important things wrong, to have guidelines and a base to build upon, and to establish the values that guide you in that task.

I've told you what a foundational philosophy is and why you need one. I hope your next thought is, "Thanks. What's next?" Well, join me here, and we'll go there together.


#### **TL;DR - Wrapping Up**



* You need a foundational philosophy to guide your life in the direction **_you_** actually want to go..
* A foundational philosophy limits your chances of getting important things wrong.
* It gives you minimal guidelines for evaluating and choosing more complex systems of belief. 
* It also establishes the fundamental values that drive your efforts.

Thanks for reading.

Until next time! **_Be better. Do more. Live well._**
